# LeftoverLink
Food waste is a significant global issue. Restaurants, caterers, and even households often have excess food that ends up in the trash, even though it is safe and consumable. At the same time, many people struggle with food insecurity.

LeftoverLink is a platform that connects individuals and organizations who have surplus food with those who need it, enabling easy sharing and reducing waste.
